I am an enviromental economics researcher studying climate, and air pollution policies. I am an incoming S.V. Ciriacy-Wantrup Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley, and in Summer 2024 I will be joining the University of Ottawa's Department of Economics, and the Institute of the Environment as an Assistant Professor.

I study the efficiency, effectiveness, and equity impacts of environmental policies to cut global and local air pollutants. My [job market paper](https://vthivierge.github.io/files/efficiency.pdf) develops an empirical framework for estimating the allocative efficiency changes of environmental markets, and applies it to landmark U.S. air pollution cap-and-trade markets. 

Other ongoing projects examine the effectiveness of carbon tariffs in reducing carbon leakage, and the air pollution and health effects of the energy transition.

I formerly worked as a researcher for think-tanks and University-based policy research institutes in Canada. I thrive to generate rigorous yet policy-relevant research.
